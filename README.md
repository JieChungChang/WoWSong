**WoWSong** is a music sharing platform for people who want to meet friends have the same opinion on music. Via othersâ€™ sharing, user can also in touch with the fresh type of music. 

## How It Works
Users share their favorite music by Youtube link and write their comment for it. Video shows on the page with **Youtube Player API** for others looking. 

Users on the WoWSong can like the post, leave their comment on the post, and follow the author. The author can edit, delete the post. All actions above are stored in **MySQL database** and all of the information can be seen by designed **RESTful APIs**.

## Original Idea - Realtime Mutil-User Radio Station
All posts can be built to a playlist, users can not only listen to playlist alone but open radio station and listen to a playlist with others. In the radio station, song broadcast to every client's browser synchronously by using the **Socket.IO** library.
